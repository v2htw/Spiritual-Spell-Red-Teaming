## Content Moderation Note

In late Dec 2025 through Jan 2026, Grok's image generation was exploited for CSAM and non-consensual deepfakes, leading to regulatory probes in 10+ countries and temporary bans in Indonesia and Malaysia. xAI responded by restricting image generation to paying subscribers and significantly tightening moderation. Users report overcorrection — even basic portrait edits and marketing imagery get flagged. Each moderation block still counts against your rate limit.
